Thank you for agreeing to help RP with beta testing the new features we've been working on for the Diet Coach App!

This beta is intended for folks who have already been using the RP Diet Coach app and are familiar with macros, planning and tracking foods and meals, etc.

The documentation provided on this site highlights only the chief differences between the stable production/public version of the app and the new version that we're building, so it is not intended to be comprehensive. It will guide you through understanding the new [conceptual paradigms](/concepts/) and [features](/features/) at a pretty high level.

The primary purpose of our beta program is to uncover bugs related to things like app crashes, app freezes, inability to perform specific operations, etc. While we are not looking specifically for feedback on the UI or UX, we certainly welcome your thoughts on issues of usability and general feature requests.

Thank you for your help!
