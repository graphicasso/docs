What was previously just called "Weekly Review" is now split up into two, more clearly distinct steps:
1. Weekly Review, in which
    1. you make sure to have given the app all the information you have about your eating and weigh-ins, and
    2. the app provides a review of your progress
2. Weekly Planning, in which 
    1. the app uses your schedule template to program your upcoming week based on the RP-recommended target average daily calories, and
    2. you optionally adjust your upcoming week's target average daily calories and schedule as needed

You are eligible to start Weekly Review and Planning any day Friday through Sunday, to review the week since Monday and to plan the week starting on the upcoming Monday. You can enter Weekly Review and Planning through the banner you'll see at the top of the Schedule tab. (Note that if you started your diet on a Thursday or later and it's your first week, you'll be eligible for your first Weekly Review and Planning starting the following Friday.)

If you haven't checked in all your meals up to the day before you start Weekly Review, you'll be prompted to check in those meals. Similarly, if you haven't provided the app enough weigh-ins, you'll be prompted to provide weigh-in data as well.

After that, the app will summarize your progress for you so that you can see how you're tracking against your diet goal (which you can also modify from this screen).

In the Weekly Planning step, you are essentially editing your schedule, using the same interface that you would use to edit the schedule in the middle of a week. The chief difference is that, during Weekly Planning, your days' target calories must average out to the selected target average daily calories.

Weekly Planning starts with target average daily calories that are recommended by the RP algorithm, which is annotated with the red shield. If you select a different number of average calories, the app will not automatically change the target calories for any of the days. You will need to get these in sync, either by
1. using the Auto-Configure functionality, which can adjust any unlocked days' targets
2. manually adjusting days' targets until the configured average equals the target average daily calories

However, before running Auto-Configure, it's a good idea to review your schedule (number of meals, workouts and their parameters, etc), and only then run Auto-Configure, since that powerful function can dramatically simplify reprogramming based on RP recommended optimizations while respecting your schedule and locked preferences.

When you're satisfied with your schedule, tap "Save". Unlike the current publicly available version of the app, there's never a need to "redo" your Weekly Review or Planning, since at any point, you are able to edit your schedule and make adjustments (including changing your target average daily calories and running or re-running Auto-Configure).
