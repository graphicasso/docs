We are moving away from the "sleep" concept in the app in favor of configuring the time range in which you want the app to program meals for you.

While the previous versions of the app provided modest macro adjustments on the basis of the duration of your sleep, we have found that this is a minor optimization in the algorithm and not worth the added complexity of sleep sessions straddling day boundaries when you're trying to configure your schedule.

When you're first configuring a diet or editing your schedule template, you can now specify, day by day, when you want the app to program meals for you.

For instance, instead of saying that you sleep from 9pm on Thursday to 5am on Friday and 10pm on Friday to 7am on Saturday, you would now specify that you want the app to program meals from 5am to 10pm on Friday.

Note that this time range only affects the RP algorithm's automatic programming during [Weekly Planning](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/weekly-review-and-weekly-planning/) and when using the ["Adjust times of unlocked meals" option of Auto-configure](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/auto-configure/#adjust-times-of-unlocked-meals). You always have the power to add meals outside that window, whether in the current week's schedule as you're running your diet, in [Weekly Planning](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/weekly-review-and-weekly-planning/), or in your [schedule template](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/concepts/schedule/) as a "manual meal".
