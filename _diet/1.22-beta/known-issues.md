Following are a few known issues in the beta. We are aware of them, so it's not important that you report them to us. Some are bugs, some are performance issues, and some are areas for UI improvement.

* The app will sometimes flicker between screen transitions.
* Performing certain operations and transitioning between screens can sometimes be sluggish. Please be patient!
* When adding foods to a meal, there are duplicative buttons on each of the three steps: There are buttons that scroll with the food list, and there are buttons that float on top of the food list. These buttons are for adding proteins, fats, carbs, other foods, and accessing the barcode scanner.
